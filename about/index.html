            As a Writing Partner, I paired with undergraduate English Language Learners who are struggling to meet the demands of university writing through the NYU Expository Writing Program.
            I met with 6 peers weekly or bi-weekly throughout the semester, acting as a collaborator, supporting my peers at every stage of the writing process.
            Additionally, I represented New York University and the NYU Writing Center at regional writing conferences, and I attended the Northeast Writing Center Association Conference as a speaker and representative.
