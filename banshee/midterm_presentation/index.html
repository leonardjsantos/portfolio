    <h3>Origin & Description</h3>
    <p>Banshee! is a project that I recently began developing after hearing about the original origin of
      the titular entity. Apparently, banshees have usually been depicted as mystical, mysterious women
      who would appear in a situation that involved death in a way. This meant that the banshee would
      come forward if someone has recently died or is about to die. I decided to create a reinterpretation
      of this myth, in which the banshee is actually present to collect recently departed souls to give
      them safe passageway to the Underworld before demons are able to claim them. The famous banshee
      scream, which was originally cited as the wailing of a weeping woman in grief, has been altered to
      become a moment of power for the banshee as a way to ward off evil spirits.</p>
    <h3>Process</h3>
    <p>I started by animating all of the figures, beginning with Banshee, the demons, and the souls.
      I animated them by drawing several images of all the elements, and then I put them all into a
      for loop which created a sense of movement. I also drew the background as well, and typed in
      all of the game mechanics in order to make this game functional.</p>
