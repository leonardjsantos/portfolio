  <h1 class="index_title" style="font-size:30px;">~premise~</h1>

  <p class="section_writeup">In my project, I will study how LGBTQ+ organizations provide mental health support and resources through social and digital media and assess if they are effective in suicide prevention. The ultimate goal is to figure out how to effectively prevent suicide in queer youths and then implement that into a wider network of organizations and communities.</p>

  <p class="section_writeup">Suicide rates among LGBTQ+ youths are disproportionately high when compared to heterosexual, cisgender peers. Multiple organizations have attempted to use new tools in the digital age to combat this, especially since the Internet provides a relatively accessible platform to youths who live in intolerant areas of the country who have the least amount of autonomy. However, this hasnâ€™t had a major effect on suicide rates, which are still increasing with every year. Something must change.</p>

  <h1 class="index_title" style="font-size:30px;">~claims~</h1>

  <ul class="premise_list">
    <li>Suicide is not the issue that young LGBTQ+ people face, but it is a symptom</li>
    <li>The United States has been historically ill-equipped to handle these issues that affect such a large part of its population</li>
    <li>Organizations, in an attempt to address these concerns, utilize social media, digital media, and the Internet</li>
  </ul>
