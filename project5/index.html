        <h3>Origin & Description</h3>
        <p>Rose-Tinted Theatre is a company dedicated to showcasing and reimagining existing theatrical
          narratives into joyful, triumphant stories about the LGBTQ+ community. As one of the founders
          and directors of the company, this is our official website that we are using to both promote
          the launch of Rose-Tinted as well as raise awareness and funds for our first production: a
          trans reimagining of Legally Blonde: The Musical. The website serves as a gateway for knowledge
          for the general public so that they may learn about our mission, donate to our most recent
          project, and join the team.</p>
        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>I co-founded Rose-Tinted Theatre Company with my two best friends, Teagan Rabuano and
          Malichi Morris. Within this team, I specialize in media editing, web design, music directing
          and transposing, and other administrative tasks such as budgeting and scheduling. I coded
          the entire website using HTML and CSS, and I uploaded it online after buying a custom domain
          by going through GitHub Pages. The website, combined with our social media strategies using
          photographs and videos that I took and edited, have helped us gain $1,000 in donations,
          multiple applications to join the team, and hundreds of views, likes, and follows in Facebook
          and Instagram.</p>
