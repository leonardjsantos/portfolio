    <p>
      Under the Surface is an escape the room adventure that tells the story of a young man who tries to bring
      his lover back to life. I used A-Frame virtual reality to create the entire project, and I wrote the story myself
      and designed most of the 2-D illustrations featured.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started by making the environment and caged in the area using collision detection. Also, I used collision detection to
      create multiple floors so that the player could have more areas to explore. Afterwards, I created the key system so that
      the user had to press all of the keys in a certain order in order to finish the game, and also used distance calculation to
      figure out where the user was in relation to a key so that it could show a new diary entry. In order to make sure that the
      diary entry showed itself cleanly and that I could get out of it, I made invisible blocks to teleport to and HTML elements
      that I hid and revealed throughout the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, I put down the aesthetic points of the game. I made a few revolving planets, created the sky, and also put in the
      assets for the stairs, floors, and walls for the environment. Also, I got 3-D models from Google Poly and also put in my own
      illustrations.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the future, I'd like to create more levels and choices for the player and not condense the whole story into one whole floor.
