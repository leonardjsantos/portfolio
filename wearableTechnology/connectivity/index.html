			<p>Turn one of your previous wearable project into a wireless one.</p>

		<h3 id="brainstorming" class="sectiontitle">Brainstorming</h3>

			<p>
				For this project, I will be redoing my Riverdale-based project from the <a href="https://leonardsantos.com/wearableTechnology/senses/">senses</a> portion of the
				semester. For a quick reminder, I created a skirt that emanated sound whenever the user shook their hips to represent the unnecessarily loud sounds coming from the
				Riverdale actors during their Heather's special.
			</p>

			<p>
				Here is the project:

			<p>
				My idea for this project is to now create a project wear the user would be able to shake their hips and now play a song from a separate device, much like the actual
				musical episode.

		<h3 id="process" class="sectiontitle">Process</h3>

		<p>to help me start off this project, I referenced two of the examples that Jingwen had provided in class: the
			<a href="https://github.com/ZhuJingwen/intro-to-wearables-itp/blob/master/Week%207%20Examples/Week7_Example_BLE_Accelerometer/Week7_Example_BLE_Accelerometer.ino">
				Arduino BLE accelerometer code
			</a>
			and the
			<a href="https://editor.p5js.org/jingwen_zhu/sketches/9ErxItiEG">
				p5 code.
			</a>
		</p>

		<p>
			Using these examples (and by downloading all of the relevant files and libraries onto my local computer), I began the process of putting my project together.
		</p>

		<p>
			My first challenge was figuring out how to register when the accelerometer was and was not in motion.
			I was able to figure this out by creating a variable to keep track of two data points; the absolute values of the position of accelerometer was in the moment
			and the position of the accelerometer right beforehand. I made the program recognize if those two values were far enough apart
			to consider the accelerometer to be "in motion", and it worked!
		</p>

		<p>
			Unfortunately, I came across another issue; sometimes, the program would keep alternating between "motion" and "not in motion" since it kept tracking the position
			of the accelerometer so quickly, so I created a few more variables so that it was a little bit more forgiving of smaller, longer movements.

		<p>
			Finally, now that I was able to get the computer to recognize the two states of "motion" and "not in motion" accurately, I took
			an MP3 clip of the song "Candy Store" from Heathers: The Musical, and I was able to get it to play using the p5.js sound library.

		<p>
			Here is the final video of the product! If I had access to materials, I would want to sew this into a skirt like my
			previous project, but unfortunately, this is the best I can do for now. I hope you enjoy!
