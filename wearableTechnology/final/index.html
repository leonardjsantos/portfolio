			<p>
				Now that I'm in quarantine, it's difficult to workout or stay active since I can't leave my home.
				Additionally, now that I can't get a haircut, I've had to resort to wearing bandanas most of the time to keep my hair out of my face.
			</p>
			<p>
				I've decided to combine my new knowledge of wearable technology with my bandanas and home workout routine to create something I can wear that shows my workout progress.
			</p>
			<p>This will be done by combining an Adafruit Flora board with an accelerometer and three Neo-Pixels that will all light up the more you move while wearing the bandana!</p>

			<p>I first began my process by testing out the lights of my NeoPixels. I took two of them and made them show different colors at different times. I was able to do this and toggle the two lights to turn on and off again in red and blue.</p>
			<div class="final_video">
				<video controls="controls" width="800" height="600" name="process1" src="assets/processmovie1.mp4"></video>
			</div>
			<p>I added a third NeoPixel to complete the set.</p>
			<img src="assets/processpic1.jpg" alt="processpic1" width="30%">
			<p>And then, I changed the code in order to also include the third NeoPixel to turn green when the others are off.</p>
			<div class="final_video">
				<video controls="controls" width="800" height="600" name="process1" src="assets/processmovie2.mp4"></video>
			</div>
			<p>Finally, in order to make it appear like a loading screen, I changed it so that the previously lit NeoPixels will just change color instead of turning off in order to show a loading screen.</p>
			<div class="final_video">
				<video controls="controls" width="800" height="600" name="process1" src="assets/processmovie3.mp4"></video>
			</div>

			<p>Next, I moved onto working on the bandana itself.</p>
			<img src="assets/processpic2.jpg" width="500px" height="auto" alt="bandana">

			<p>I started with the battery pouch where my lithium battery would be held. I sewed it in underneath where the Flora board would be located.</p>

			<img src="assets/processpic4.jpg" width="500px" height="auto" alt="batterypouch">

			<p>Then, I worked on sewing in the Adafruit Flora board and acclerometer onto a strap to later put onto the bandana. To make sure that it would make sense, I plotted out where the lines would go with chalk before sewing it in.</p>
			<img src="assets/processpic5.jpg" width="500px" height="auto" alt="accelerometer">
			<img src="assets/processpic6.jpg" width="500px" height="auto" alt="accelerometer">

			<p>I coded in more instructions so that moving the accelerometer would trigger a different reaction from the boolean (LIGHT 1, LIGHT 2, LIGHT 3, NO LIGHT) depending on how long it would move (moveCount).</p>
