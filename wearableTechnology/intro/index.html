		<p><i>Due: February 11, 2020 - </i></p>
		<p>Create an LED embroidery soft circuit. Schematic is shown below. You could add more LEDs or more switches. The embroidery could be on a piece of textile or on clothing. Be "creative" with the switch.</p>

		<p>
			My idea is to create a light up glove inspired by one of the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s (MCU) most iconic items: the Infinity Gauntlet (pictured below).
		</p>

		<img src="assets/brainstorming1_infinitygauntlet.jpg" alt-"brainstorming1_infinitygauntlet">

		<p>
			In short, the Infinity Gauntlet is basically a giant glove wielded by the antagonist (Thanos) that can use these cosmically-powered items known as the Infinity Stones to warp the fabric of reality. Within the MCU, it’s activated whenever Thanos closes his hand. This causes the Infinity Stones to light up on the back of his hand as he uses the powers of the Infinity Gauntlet.
		</p>

		<p>
			My goal is to create a similar glove that lights up whenever the user’s hand closes. My goal is to put the battery in the middle of the palm which will light up LED lights on the back of the hand whenever the middle finger makes contact with the middle of the palm (which requires the user to close their hand).
		</p>

		<p>
			While my glove will be unfortunately unable to manipulate reality like the actual Infinity Gauntlet, I hope that this will be a fun exercise in creatively applying my new knowledge of soft circuits.
		</p>


		<h3 id="process" class="sectiontitle">Process</h3>

		<p>
			I officially began this process by going to the ITP Soft Lab to gather my materials for this project. I used the following for this project:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>A glove (previously bought from H&M)</li>
			<li>Fabric</li>
			<li>Battery</li>
			<li>2 LED lights</li>
			<li>Conductive thread</li>
			<li>Conductive fabric</li>
			<li>A ruler</li>
			<li>Fabric scissors</li>
			<li>Chalk</li>
			<li>Pliers</li>
		</ol>

		<p>
			The first part of my glove that I made was a pocket that could hold my battery. I experimented with a few different formats before settling on my final one (with help from Jingwen!).
		</p>

		<p>
			With the current model, the conductive fabric will connect with the switch (on the middle finger) to light up with the LED while the conductive thread on the back will act as the ground.
		</p>

		<p>
			Next, I started working the back of the hand where I’d place the LED light that will connect to the switch, or middle finger. I measured the dimensions of the glove and drew up a shape of the fabric that would fit my hand like so:

		<p>
			Afterwards, I sewed in an LED light to the fabric and used conductive fabric to sew a circuit all the way to the other side of the fabric.
		</p>

		<p>
			To test to see if it worked, I temporarily sewed the ground of the battery pack with the cathode of the LED to have this result:

		<p>
			After I got one light to work, I decided to go home to get some rest before cleaning up the glove and putting in the final light!
		</p>

		<p>The next day that I came in, I separated the light fabric from the glove to I could easily put in the second LED. I sewed it in next to the original LED light.</p>

		<p>Afterwards, I sewed the fabric back onto my glove. To make sure that I didn't sew the glove shut, I sewed with my hand inside of the glove (and I luckily didn't stab myself too much).</p>

		<p>Next, I sewed in the battery pack onto the palm of my glove by using the conductive thread to connect the ground to the LED batteries. Finally, I tested it before officially sewing the battery onto the glove.</p>
