        The greatest demand of LGBTQ+ youth mental health support is in the South, shown by the fact that they
        utilize social media resources the most in those states. However, LGBTQ+ youth suicide remains high in that
        area. Those areas have little protection against discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation,
        and most of them allow conversion therapy for minors. Despite attempts to try to use digital technology
        and social media as a way to provide outreach and support for the queer community, oppressive systems and cultures
        still dominate the area.

          <h3>Social Media Utilization</h3>
          <h4>How should we use social media?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Social media is not a means of therapy or mental health support for the LGBTQ+ youth community</li>
            <li>The main purposes of social media seem to be creating a public image of an organization,
              promoting events, or raising funds</li>
            <li>Overall, it's for supporting in-person resources for the community</li>

          <h3>Wellness for the LGBTQ+ Community</h3>
          <h4>What needs to be addressed for LGBTQ+ youth wellness</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>We need a culture shift to create a space for LGBTQ+ youth to exist</li>
            <li>Wellness for LGBTQ+ youth has specific requirements</li>
            <li>More in-person centers for support are required</li>

        <h3>What does this all mean?</h3>
        <p>
          Suicide in the LGBTQ+ youth community is not the problem; it's a symptom of much larger issues
          in the United States that fail to protect queer people. Youths, who have the least amount of
          autonomy and power financially and legally, are at the greatest risk because systems of
          society treat them as if they're the other, and they don't have the ability to fight back.
        </p>
        <p>
          For long-term wellness, we need extensive changes to our laws, our education and healthcare systems, and our
          culture as a whole. But until then, we need to provide in-person support for the children that need it most.
