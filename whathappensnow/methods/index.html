        <h3>exploring my own community</h3>
        <p class="methods_text">
          An autoethnography, as described by Colin Martin Brown, is "a study of a culture... using [yourself] and [your] personal experiences as the major focus". Brown explains the development of autoethnography, saying that ethnographies gained credibility in the 1960s during the feminist movement as it was able to effectively convey the struggles and discrimination women were facing. This seems to be because ethnographies, and autoethnographies by extension, are able to provide focus into a community that cannot be expressed by other means of study. As Brown states, "these new forms of research, such as autoethnography, go beyond figures and statistics and tell the real-life phenomena of issues that lay behind the statistics."" They allow researchers to tap into the emotion and affective experiences of people, which are often ignored in purely statistical studies, in a way that only a person from those people can understand.

        <h2 class="methods_title">Interview</h2>
        <h3>sitting down with those in the field</h3>
        <p class="methods_text">
          According to Jaber F. Gubrium and James A. Holstein in "From the Individual Interview to the Interview Society", widespread utilization of interviewing individuals is a fairly recent development in the United States. While the basic concept of receiving information from someone else through asking them to respond to an inquiry has always existed in some form, the modern form of the interview took root after World War II (Gubrium and Holstein, 3). As explained by the article, "individuals became accustomed to offering information and opinions that had no immediate bearing on their lives and social relations" (3). In other words, the general populace became more comfortable with sharing information as researchers became more interested in experiential information. Today, interviews have seen much more widespread use. David Riesman and Benney (1956) attribute this to the "modern temper", which "denotes a shared understanding that the individual has the wherewithal to offer a meaningful description of, or set of opinions about, his or her life". We interview people because there's supposed mutual agreement that everyone has worthwhile thoughts to submit into conversations.
