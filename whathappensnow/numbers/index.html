          lgbtq+ youths are at least four times as likely to commit and attempt suicide
          than their heterosexual, cisgender peers. this is likely to be a much larger number

          culture shapes the way we personally interact with one another, and the acceptance and support
          of identity is crucial for young people. lgbtq+ youths are eight times as likely to commit suicide
          if they are rejected by the family upon coming out, as it removes any sense of personal foundation.

          the lgbtq+ community has historically been failed by the healthcare system in america. queerness was
          only removed as a mental illness by the american psychiatry association in 1973. however, claims that
          queerness is a condition to be cured continue to persist in our society. conversion therapy is completely
          legal in thirty-five of our fifty states in 2019.
