          LGBTQ+ youths are at least <u><i>four</i></u> times as likely to commit and attempt suicide
          than their heterosexual, cisgender peers. This is likely to be a much larger number
          since this only accounts for those who openly identify as a part of the lgbtq+ community.

          Culture shapes the way we personally interact with one another, and the acceptance and support
          of identity is crucial for young people. LGBTQ+ youths are <u><i>eight</i></u> times as likely to commit suicide
          if they are rejected by the family upon coming out, as it removes any sense of personal foundation.

          The LGBTQ+ community has historically been failed by the healthcare system in america. Queerness was
          only removed as a mental illness by the american psychiatry association in 1973. However, claims that
          queerness is a condition to be cured continue to persist in our society. Conversion therapy is completely
          legal in <u><i>thirty-five</i></u> of our fifty states in 2019.
